Jamais Vu is a series of modifications to different games.
The main idea is that after installing the modification, the player gets a completely new game in terms of gameplay, but with an old story line.

This modification has "mini" in the name, not because the number of changes in the game is small.
At the moment, this is the biggest modification to the game.
This mod has a "mini" in the name because, against the background of other modifications from the Jamais Vu series, its scale is small.

A detailed description of the modification can be found on the mod page on Nexusmods.
To do this, follow this link:

Below is a generalized description of the mod, without a detailed description.


Key features of the mod:

1) Changed all the parameters of all units in the game.
2) All units have their role and place on battlefield. Light type of soldier didnt mean weak soldier.
3) Very big difference in available tactics for different types of troops in tactic and global maps battles.
4) Redone the endurance, morality and AI logic of troops.
5) The new skill system, up to 10 skills, that are balanced for the game.
6) Bonuses from traditions are changed, as well as the cost of studying.
7) The Pagan religion are rebalanced and can be well playable now.
8) Countries receive 40% of resources in cities without a governor.
9) Bonuses from resources to units are changed.

I want to say kind words to the people whose work I have been looking through in order to find the values
I need, to understand how individual things work.

I am grateful for the work of the following authors:
1. Vaweila for "Aging Knight's" and "No Ungoverned Province Penalty" mods.
2. 13erserk for "10 Skill Slots and Level 5 skills" mod.
3. VampiresZombiesLiches for "Extended Royal Family Age and Expanded Family Tree and Better Marriages and Birthrate" mod.

I cannot guarantee compatibility with other modifications.
It is better to use this global modification in stand alone mode.
